Changelog

1.1.0.1	2006-05-14 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- A compilation fix (thanks to Cu Van Chuoi)

1.1.0	2006-05-14 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- Removed OpenSSL dependency
- Replaced MD5 with CRC32 for smaller memory usage in mkcromfs
  (This has no effect in data integrity; a hash is just a hash.)
- Worked around an instability problem when used together with reiserfs4
  (mmapping a sparse file as read-write with copy-on-write mapping,
   and changing that underlying file, seems to under some circumstances
   cause kernel crash and kernel BUGs when the underlying filesystem is
   reiser4.)
- Disabled the auto deallocator hack for now; it hasn't worked properly.
- Changed FSIZE semantics: fsize now denotes the maximum uncompressed
 fblock size, not the maximum compressed fblock size. This made mkcromfs
 somewhat easier in design, and probably more useful for the users too.
- Removed mkcromfs option: --tryhard
- Added mkcromfs option: --autoindexratio
- Documentation updates

1.0.6	2006-05-12 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- Another compilation fix
- Documentation updates
- mkcromfs's temporary directory now configurable
 (recognizes the environment variable TEMP or TMP)
- mkcromfs optimization: Uses mmapping to compare portions of files.
 Most effective when used together with --decompresslookups.

1.0.5.1	2006-05-12 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- A compilation fix

1.0.5	2006-05-11 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- Added compatibility for older versions of Fuse
 (2.5.2 now supported, previously only compiled on 2.6.0)
- Changed filesystem format: FBLOCKs are now stored without padding.
 This will result in better compression, and opens opportunities
 to make mkcromfs faster.
- Added commandline option in mkcromfs:
 --tryhard

1.0.4	2006-05-11 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- Documentation updates
- Fixed mkcromfs error from 1.0.3 version
- Added commandline options in mkcromfs:
 --decompresslookups, --randomcompressperiod and --minfreespace

1.0.3   2006-05-11 Joel Yliluoma <bisqwit@iki.fi>
- Documentation updates
- Broken mkcromfs release
- Added statistics reporting in mkcromfs at end

1.0.2
- Added support for block devices and character devices
- Documentation updates
- Added commandline options in mkcromfs: --bsize, --fsize
- Fixed exception handling in cromfs-driver
- Changed cromfs-driver so that uid/gid now refer to the one
 who mounted the filesystem, not root
- Disabled the tracing output in cromfs-driver by default
- Changed attribute cache timeout to ~infinite
- Added periodical deallocation of BLKTAB
- Added cache of read_dir() when it's used by lookup()
- Misc tuning in mkcromfs
- mkcromfs now can stand running multiple instances at same time
- Changed the LZMA dictionary size selection method (heavier settings now)

1.0.1
- Changed the LZMA implementation slightly more straight-forward
- Changed filesystem format: BLKTAB is now compressed within BLKDATA
- A slight speed optimization (later to become the "decompresslookups" option)

1.0.0
- Initial release
