This directory contains example scripts that can be used to create
optimized cromfs archives of various repositories of ROM images.


It is recommended to use the Screen program to create a detachable terminal
where to run the scripts, and then to monitor it in another terminal using
the "watch" program in the way described in ../progress_monitor/ .
This way, if you accidentally close a terminal or two, it won't terminate
mkcromfs. Using the progress monitor, or simply with "tail <logfile>",
or attaching the screen, you can see where the progress is going.
