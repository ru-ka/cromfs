This document describes a way to monitor the progress of mkcromfs
in a way that should be descriptive and neat even over slow SSH links.

To build, you need:
	g++, make
	
	Issue the command: make
	
To run, you need:
	bc
	lsof
	pidof (from sysvinit-utils)
	watch
	
	Issue the command: watch -n3 ./watch_keep ./run-lsof.sh
	The -n parameter describes the update interval. If your
	terminal is faster, try -n1.
	If you're on a slow SSH link, try -n5.
	
	Note: It will create a temporary file in the current
	working directory, named: .watch_keep.state
