PROCEDURE To READ THE CONTENTS OF A FILE denoted by inode number N, do:
	Load the inode to get access to its list of blocks:
		If N = 0, use the INOTAB inode. (It is stored
		          in the filesystem uncompressed, raw.
		          You can find it by following the address
		          saved in the superblock.)
		If N = 1, use the rootdir inode. (Similarly.)
		If N > 1, first load the contents of INOTAB by calling
		          this function recursively with inode number 0.
		          Then load the inode from the INOTAB. (Of course,
		          you only need to read the portion of INOTAB that
		          contains this particular inode.)
	In the inode, for each block index [that needs to be processed in
	order to access this particular portion of the file], load that
	particular BLOCK from the decompressed BLKDATA, and then load
	the FBLOCK indicated by that BLOCK, decompress it, and copy
	the necessary number of bytes from that decompressed data,
	starting from the offset indicated in the BLOCK.
	(Of course, you do not need to decompress the same FBLOCK over
	and over again, but you can cache them. Caching is applicable
	to many of the steps in this task, but a cache needs RAM.)

PROCEDURE To LIST THE CONTENTS OF A DIRECTORY denoted by inode number N, do:
	Load the contents of the file denoted by inode number N, using the
	procedure described above.
	Then decode the content of the directory data using the format
	described above ("FILE CONTENT WHEN: DIRECTORY").
