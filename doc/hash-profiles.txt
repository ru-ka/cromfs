HASH PROFILES

Tests run on Bisqwit's 80 gigabyte corpus,
using --blockindexmethod prepass

Altered newhash, 64-bit algorithm:

26558860 recurring hashes found. 58101810 unique. Prepass helped skip about 54.3% of work.

Original newhash, 64-bit algorithm:

26561593 recurring hashes found. 58110996 unique. Prepass helped skip about 54.3% of work.

CRC32:

26561633 recurring hashes found. 58112108 unique. Prepass helped skip about 54.3% of work.


Interestingly, this would give CRC32 as the best of these hashes.
However, the difference between the "best" and the, err, "worst"
is such slight that the performance difference outweighs it by
a large margin.

CRC32 hashes a byte per iteration.
  Each iteration is about 6 instructions.
  So, 6 instructions per byte.
Newhash-altered hashes 24 bytes per iteration.
  Each iteration takes some 36 instructions.
  So, 1.5 instructions per byte.
