These are the Git branches used in the Cromfs repository:

- Master:
	This documents the changelog of the software.
	It is maintained by cherry-picking and merging from the dev branch.

- Release:
	This archives each released version, and it only contains
	those files that are supposed to go to the published .tar.bz2,
	even if the repository has more files.

- Dev:
	All development takes place here.
	Occassionally it is rebased and edited from the master branch
	to clean-up the commit history.
